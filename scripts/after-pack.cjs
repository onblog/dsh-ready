/**
 * Sign the packaged macOS app before the dmg is built, with the **stable** self-signed
 * identity when the machine has it and ad-hoc otherwise.
 *
 * Why the identity matters (this is not cosmetic):
 *   - Ad-hoc (`--sign -`) produces a designated requirement of `cdhash H"…"` and nothing
 *     else — a different code identity on every build. macOS keys TCC decisions
 *     (Accessibility, Screen Recording, Full Disk Access, App Management) on that
 *     requirement, so a new version arrives as an unknown app: every permission the user
 *     granted silently stops applying, and System Settings keeps showing the stale row as
 *     ON. That is the "I granted it but it still says not granted" report.
 *   - The self-signed identity yields
 *     `identifier "com.onblog.dsh-ready" and certificate leaf = H"…"`, which is stable
 *     across rebuilds, so a grant survives application updates.
 *
 * Either way the app is not notarized, so Gatekeeper still stops a quarantined copy once
 * (allow it in System Settings → Privacy & Security). The identity is created once per
 * machine by scripts/create-signing-identity.sh and kept out of the repository.
 *
 * Signing happens here, in afterPack, so it runs on the exact bundle that goes into the
 * dmg for every architecture. electron-builder's own identity: option stays null: it is
 * easy to get wrong there, and a silently skipped signature is what produces "damaged".
